# Image processing and face classification
Image processing and classification

There are two codes, one mainly oriented to image processing with cv2 and the other to face classification.

The CascadeClassifier model, a pre-trained model for face detection, is used for classification.

The same model will then be trained on famous people and used to detect photos of them.
